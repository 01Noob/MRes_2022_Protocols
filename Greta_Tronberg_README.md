## Greta Tronberg 2022 - Automated LigASERR Protocol on Opentrons
---

### Introduction

The Greta Tronberg team decided to automate the LigASERR protocol developed by [Haines et al. (2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32995542/). Ligase-Assisted Selection for the Enrichment of Responsive Ribozymes (or LigaSERR) is an in vitro method used to select for ligand-responsive ribozymes that was developed to overcome the long and complicated workflows traditionally used for ribozyme identification. This method was developed with the objective of being high throughput. Therefore, the Greta Tronberg team selected this protocol, as automation is the logical next step for this protocol.
