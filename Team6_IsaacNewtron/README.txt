This folder contains 4 files from our project. The ipynb notebook file contains all code used, and code blocks outside run functions for simulations.
The 3 .py files contain the scripts used on the openTrons machine.
serialDil.py was used for calibrating dyes.
MoClo.py is used for combinatorial DNA assembly. Arguments for reservoir format, part volume, and the choice to reuse and wash tips are specified
at the top of the file. This script requires a thermocycler.
Transformation.py is used for transformation into E. coli, and uses the format specified in the previous MoClo script.
